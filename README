A set of scripts and services for running and maintaining a minecraft server.

Tested with Ubuntu Linux, but might work on other distro's as well. 
You might need to install python3 if not included in order to use "update.bash"

SETUP
Install a Java runtime environment.
Create a system user named "minecraft" with a home directory, ideally "/srv/minecraft".
Place both scripts in the newly created home directory.
You might want to configure both scripts before use, and explore the different functions in "minecraft.bash".
Settings are found at the top of the scripts.
Run "update.bash" to install the most recent PaperMC build, or manually download a minecraft server named "server.jar".
Start the server using "minecraft.bash start"
After the first run, you can configure the newly created setting files, such as "server.properties".
To run the server at boot, you can install "minecraft.service" in systemd and enable it.
You can also install "web.service" to allow players to download world backups.
Lastly, you can make a crontab to schedule events, in my case daily backups, updates and reboots:

50 5 * * * /srv/minecraft/minecraft.bash "backup 10" clean; /srv/minecraft/update.bash; /sbin/reboot;
